## What Are Templates?

- **Agent Templates** are pre-built agents built by domain experts, designed to handle specific tasks—such as market research, customer support, e‑commerce workflows, template management, or go‑to‑market operations. You can **clone, customize, and deploy** them to match your operating procedures.
- **Workflow Templates** power multi‑step automations across tools and teams, orchestrated by AI agents capable of decision-making, learning, and exception handling in real time.

## Why Use Templates?

- **Launch fast**: No need to build from scratch. Templates offer plug-and-play functionality.
- **Highly customizable**: Adjust behavior, memory, tools, and triggers to reflect your business logic.
- **Built by experts**: Templates are modeled on real workflows from industry domain experts.

## Agent Template Examples

- **Market Research Marco**: Automates survey and feedback analysis, converting raw data into insights in minutes—ideal for marketing, BI, or product teams.
- **Template Management Agent**: Automatically handles consistency checks, dynamic version control, and context-aware suggestions across document libraries.
- **Go‑to‑Market Operations Agent**: Orchestrates GTM workflows—market intelligence, campaign tracking, cross-team handoffs—all handled autonomously.
- Also available: E-commerce, support, analytics, and research agents.

## Workflow Templates & Automation

Workflow Templates define step-by-step processes managed by agents rather than rigid rule-based systems. Benefits include:

- Adaptive learning and decision-making
- Natural language instructions and triggers
- Seamless integration across systems
- Smart exception handling and optimization over time

## How It Works

1. **Choose** a template from the Marketplace or library (Agent or Workflow)
2. **Clone** it into your Arahi account for full editing access
3. **Customize** tools, triggers, memory, and behavior—matching your SOPs
4. **Deploy** and let your agent run autonomously across tools
5. **Iterate**: monitor, refine prompts, retrain, and optimize
