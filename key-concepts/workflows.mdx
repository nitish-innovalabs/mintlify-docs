## What Are Workflows?

Workflows in Arahi are **multi-step automations** orchestrated by AI Agents. They allow you to define sequences of tools, decision logic, and branching paths that mirror your business processes—automatically and contextually driven.

While tools handle individual tasks, workflows connect tools and reasoning to answer complex business needs.

## How Workflows Work

1. **Trigger**\
   A workflow begins when a user input, event, or agent instruction meets defined trigger conditions (e.g. “new support ticket received”).
2. **Decision Points**\
   Agents branch the workflow based on conditions (e.g. sentiment analysis, knowledge base match, prior memory).
3. **Outputs & Actions**\
   Final results can be sent externally, logged into CRM, or stored for further workflows.
4. **Review & Escalation**\
   Any uncertain steps can automatically escalate to human review, with feedback used to improve future behavior.

## Why Use Workflows?

- **Structured yet flexible**: Combine agent reasoning with tool-based actions.
- **Automated control flow**: Branching logic and conditionals let you handle exceptions and path choices.
- **Composable systems**: Pair tools modularly to build custom pipelines that match your SOPs.
- **Context-aware automation**: Memory and decision logic let agents adapt as workflows proceed.

## Common Use Cases

- **Support ticket triage**: Determine ticket category → search knowledge base → draft response → escalate if needed.
- **Lead qualification flow**: Analyze lead intent → enrich CRM → schedule follow-up or pass to human.
- **HR onboarding process**: Gather employee info → verify docs → send documentation → notify stakeholder teams.
- **Sales methodology workflows**: Detect topic fatigue → enable escalation → generate help content dynamically.
