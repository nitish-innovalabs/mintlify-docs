## What Are Integrations in Arahi?

Integrations connect Arahi AI agents to the external tools your team already uses — like **Slack**, **Microsoft Teams**, **Gmail**, **Notion**, **Google Sheets**, and thousands more. With 2800\+ supported apps, Arahi agents can automate, communicate, and act directly inside your existing workflows.

No more context-switching — let your agents operate where your team works.

## What Can Agents Do with Integrations?

- 🧠 **Pull data** from CRMs, task managers, or dashboards
- 📨 **Send messages or emails** via Slack, Teams, or Gmail
- 🧾 **Log actions** in tools like Notion, ClickUp, Trello, or Airtable
- 📊 **Update records** in Google Sheets or Salesforce
- 🧰 **Trigger downstream automations** via webhooks, APIs, or third-party services
