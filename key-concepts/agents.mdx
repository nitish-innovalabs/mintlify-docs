## What Is an AI Agent?

In Arahi, an **AI Agent** is an autonomous, reasoning assistant powered by LLMs. It plans, evaluates, and executes tasks on autopilot, leveraging tools and custom domain knowledge to achieve defined goals. The agent decides how best to use resources—without requiring human oversight.

## Core Capabilities

- **Reasoning & Planning:** Agents use LLMs to break down goals into actionable steps and determine which tools or workflows to activate.
- **Tool Integration:** Agents can interact with external services and APIs (e.g., CRMs, Slack, Google Sheets) to complete tasks and retrieve information.
- **Optional Escalation:** If uncertain, an agent can escalate steps or queries for human review—or store feedback to learn from future interactions.

## When to Use an AI Agent \> Tool

| Use Case Scenario                                       | Choose an Arahi Agent When...                      |
| :------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------- |
| Task involves multiple decision points or tools         | Agent can orchestrate decision-making and tool use |
| Natural language interaction or dynamic behavior needed | Agents adapt responses based on context            |
| Workflows require memory across sessions                | Agent can remember and learn over time             |
| Human oversight is required for edge cases              | Agent can escalate and learn from feedback         |

## How Arahi Agents Work — Summary Flow

1. **Instruction input**: The agent receives a user goal (e.g. “Qualify this lead”).
2. **Planning**: Generates a step-by-step approach using its tools and memory.
3. **Execution**: Calls APIs, queries knowledge bases, or interacts with documents/chats.
4. **Decision making**: Chooses next actions autonomously or with human review.
5. **Learning**: Escalations and outcomes are stored to improve future reasoning.
